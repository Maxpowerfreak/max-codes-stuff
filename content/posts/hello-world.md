Hello folks! 

My name is Maxime Delcourt, I've been a Software Developer for 6 years. Throughout my career so far, I've primarily specialized in back-end work and data. I've been seeing some of my friends and colleague rocking their own websites, so I've decided to hop on the bandwagon!

**Max Codes Things** will mainly serve as a link to my (quite empty as of right now) Github and my LinkedIn, and a place for me to write down my thoughts about programming and perhaps even some hobby-related things!
